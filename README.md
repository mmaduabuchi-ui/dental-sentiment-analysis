# 🦷 Dental Clinic Sentiment Analyzer (NLP Project)

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify real customer reviews of dental clinics into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** sentiments.

## 🎯 Problem

Most dental clinics in Nigeria don’t gather or analyze structured patient feedback. This means valuable reviews — whether about pain, treatment quality, or satisfaction — go unused. My project offers a data-driven way to extract insights from these reviews using AI.

## 🧠 Solution

I built a sentiment analysis model using:
- **TF-IDF vectorization**
- **Logistic Regression**

The model was trained on real Yelp dental reviews and achieved **89% accuracy**.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: Real Yelp reviews (scraped and cleaned)
- Processing: Stopword removal, tokenization, vectorization

## 📈 Results

| Sentiment    | Example Review                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Positive     | “The staff was amazing and very friendly.”     |
| Neutral      | “I visited the clinic last week.”              |
| Negative     | “The dentist was rude and caused me pain.”     |
