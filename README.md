# 🦷 Dental Clinic Sentiment Analysis (NLP Project)

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify real customer reviews of dental clinics into three sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative.

## 👨‍🔬 Problem

Dental clinics in Nigeria and globally often lack structured feedback systems. Patients’ experiences—both good and bad—are often ignored. This project provides a way to **automatically analyze text feedback** to guide service improvement.

## 🧠 Solution

I built a sentiment analysis model using:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- **Logistic Regression Classifier**

The model achieved **89% accuracy** on real review data.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: Real Yelp dental reviews
- Cleaned and preprocessed using Python (NLTK, regex)

## 📦 Libraries Used

- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib (for basic visualization)

## 📈 Results

The model can classify feedback into:
- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative
